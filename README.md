# Anti Cheat system by implementing RL agents in Unity

## Game called "Courier"
*Carry Boxes, Avoid Objects*

Blue side versus Red side. In order to win the game, you need to transfer all boxes to your side in certain time.

If players collide, both of the sides are dropping packages (if carrying one).

Packages are spawn in random places with color of each team. Players are spawn in their base.

At every time, players can be struck with objects and drop their package.
After struck with object or colliding with another player, package will fall in random direction.
